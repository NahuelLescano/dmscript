* My personal dmscripts.
Those are some useful dmenu scripts that I use:
 - *dm-radio:* choose between online radio stations with dmenu.
 - *dm-wiki:* search an offline article copy from the arch wiki. You have to install /arch-wiki-docs./
 - *dm-confedit:* choose from a list a configuration file to work with. I use /doom emacs/ but you can use
   whatever you want to use such as /nvim./
 - *dm-websearch:* search from various search engines. I use /brave/ but you can use other browser.
 - *dm-bookman:* search from [[https://www.qutebrowser.org/][qutebrowser]] bookmarks, quickmarks and history url.
 - *dm-document:* search from pdfs files and opens them from a pdf viewer (I use [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zathura_(document_viewer)][zathura]]).
 - *dm-kill:* search from a process to kill.
 - *dm-logout:* shutdown, reboot, log out or suspend the system.
 - *dm-man:* search for a man page or choose a random one to read.
 - *dm-maim:* take a screenshoot using maim.
 - *dm-youtube:* view youtube suscription videos using bash scripting.
